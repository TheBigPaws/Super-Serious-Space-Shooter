SSSS (Super Serious Space Shooter)

////////////////////////////

-INFO:-

	SSSS was made as a final project for 1st year Game Dev course at Abertay University. 
	
	It is a pretty much project I am quite proud of. I do, however, plan to revisit it once, to add more features, fix performance issues that pop up in late-game.

	~Hints for Cheat Codes:~
	1, Relevantly named song by David Bowie
	2, Common command to be invincible
	3, ? ;) 
	

-SETUP:-

	1.Start by extracting the downloaded github file.
	2a. To simply run the application, go inside Executable folder and run SSSS.exe
	2b. To view the code, open the solution file in the Source Code file. This application has been written using Visual Studio framework.

-LEGAL:-

	This Project is open source and was made for educational purposes.
